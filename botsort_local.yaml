# Modified BoT-SORT config for low-confidence segmentation models

tracker_type: botsort  # ['botsort', 'bytetrack']

# --- Association thresholds ---
track_high_thresh: 0.2    # lowered (was 0.5) — allow weaker detections in first matching
track_low_thresh: 0.1     # lowered (was 0.1) — allow even weaker matches in second pass
new_track_thresh: 0.25     # lowered (was 0.6) — allow starting new tracks with low-confidence boxes
track_buffer: 30           # slightly increased (was 30) — keep track longer when confidence fluctuates
match_thresh: 0.8          # slightly lowered (was 0.8) — allow more lenient matching between frames
fuse_score: True           # keep True — improves stability when confidence is inconsistent

# --- Area and ReID ---
# min_box_area: 5          # optional: set lower if cracks/potholes are small
with_reid: False           # keep False unless you use a ReID model
proximity_thresh: 0.5
appearance_thresh: 0.25

# --- Global motion compensation (GMC) ---
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow  # good balance for real road video; keeps stable tracking

# Optional debug/tuning flags (uncomment for testing)
# debug: True
